# Totem-Drawing

A creative tool for making geometrically symmetric designs.

Starting from the dot at the top of the grid, click gridline intersections to connect new sides. Stay to one side of the grid, the other side will be mirroring the newly created lines. Once the mirrored halves connect at a point, the drawing phase is completed.

Subsequent clicks will can be used to add intricacy to the totem. Start on the border to create a dividing line somewhere on the totem. I like to use these to mark where new colors will fill in the "arms" of the shapes. Once a dividing line is finished, press 'l' to finish it and prepare to start a new one.

At any time, press 'g' to toggle the gridlines. Take a screenshot and fill in the totem any way you want! See the 'demos' folder for examples. This project was inspired by many sheets of graph paper I colored in as a kid!
